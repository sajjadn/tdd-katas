AS A Business Analyst

I NEED TO have access to the daily revenue from different stores and profit from different brands

SO THAT I can make informed policy decisions

Brand Identification
Item Type="Jeans" => LEVIS
Item Code has pattern "GA00xx" => GAP
Item Type="Jacket" and ItemCode has pattern "PUM_xx_yy" => PUMA
Item Type="Shoes" => NIKE

Tech Approach:-
Use the Transactions API to fetch daily transactions.
Process the API Response and save to Reports DB
Destination - Revenue table to have following fields:-
Date
Store 
Total Revenue
NoOfTransactions

Destination - Brand Profit table to have following fields:-
Date
Brand 
Total Profit
Total Items

NFR:-

Process to return a '0' exit code for success and '1' return code for failure
Retry - Return code of '400' if Transactions API is not responding
Log total transactions, revenue per store, any errors in the process
Process should be re-runnable (Overwrite if data exists for the same date already)
